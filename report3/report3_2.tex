\section{Assignment 2}
Efficiency comparison of shared memory and distributed message passing.  To gather the results presented below, see the table below, two different GSM voice codec implementations was used and simulated in mparm. Using mparm some tests were conducted to asses the impact that the frequency of the different processors had upon the system.  By reducing the frequency with a divider of 2 as can be seen in test 6 in the table, both the traffic and the busyness of the bus has been reduced quite a lot.  Compared to the first test where the system ran with the default settings this is an improvement of efficiency and energy consumption without sacrificing to much execution time.
