** Assignment 1
*** 3.1 Getting started

   For the first query E<> P.s3 witch means that there exist a possible future where P.s3 holds. The result is that the property is satisfied witch is true since there is a possible sequence of state transitions leading form the initial state to s3.
   An example sequence : S0 -> S1 -> S3

   For the second query A<> P.s3 witch means that all possible sequence of states that eventually leads to P.s3. The property is not satisfied since there is no way to ensure that there is such a sequence. This is due to the fact that there is nothing forcing the states to change.
   An example sequence: S0     The state machine will stay in S0 for infinity. 
   
*** 3.2 Fisher 1

    n : 8     1s  
    n : 9     2s
    n : 10    6s
    n : 11    20s  
    n : 12    120s (Our guess) 

    It seems to be a factorial increment of time.
