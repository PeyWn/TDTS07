---Cache performance---
* Read bursts due to 12 cache misses out of 202 cacheable reads. Misses
also cost 72 int cycles to refill. All writes were write-through.
Reads are done by reading tag and data in parallel (so data reads happen
even on cache misses); write-throughs always involve a tag read followed,
only in case of hit, by a data word write.
D-Cache: 54 read hits; 4 read misses (16 single-word refills)
D-Cache: 10 write-through hits; 2 write-through misses
D-Cache total: 70 tag reads, 4 tag writes
               58 data reads, 4 data line writes, 10 data word writes
D-Cache Miss Rate: 8.00%
I-Cache: 148 read hits; 8 read misses (32 single-word refills)
I-Cache: 0 write-through hits; 0 write-through misses
I-Cache total: 156 tag reads, 8 tag writes
               156 data reads, 8 data line writes, 0 data word writes
I-Cache Miss Rate: 5.71%
