\section{Fisher 1}
\label{sec:orga07fe9b}
For this assignment we try to predict the verification time for fisher with n = 12. We used a android phone to measure time since uppaal doesn't report it.

\begin{itemize}
\item n : 8     1s
\item n : 9     2s
\item n : 10    6s
\item n : 11    20s
\item n : 12    120s (Our guess)
\end{itemize}

It seems to be a factorial increment of time.
