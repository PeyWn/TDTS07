For the first query E<> P.s3 which means that there exists a possible future where P.s3 holds. The result is that the property is satisfied which is true since there is a possible sequence of state transitions leading from the initial state to s3.
An example sequence : S0 $\rightarrow$ S1 $\rightarrow$ S3

For the second query A<> P.s3 which means that all possible sequence of states that eventually leads to P.s3. The property is not satisfied since there is no way to ensure that there is such a sequence. This is due to the fact that there is nothing forcing the states to change.
An example sequence: S0     The state machine will stay in S0 for infinity.
