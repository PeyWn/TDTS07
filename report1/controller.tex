\section{Controller module}
% Write about the purpose of the Module
% Explain the module signals
The controller module contains all to the logic needed to control a traffic light in a four way junction with traffic flowing in four directions. However dose not support turning traffic, for example a car can't go from north to west. The module have four input signals, one form each direction. This signal tells the controller if there is any cars waiting for a green light. There is also four boolean output signals to represent a green or a read light. The controller have one thread and a print method. The print method is triggered form the tread and prints the current state of the traffic lights. The controllers thread is covered in greater detail in the next section.
