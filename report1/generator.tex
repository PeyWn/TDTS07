\section{Generator module}

The generator module simulates cars in order to show the different properties of the lights. 
To prove those properties, two differents modules has been created.
The first one generates pseudo-random cars to show the behaviour of the lights during a time period.
The other one generates cars by reading a text file file to show all possible cases, one by one. 

The generator contains a print method, a generator method and a thread to trigger the generator method.

\subsection{Event thread}

The event{\_}creator is a thread that triggers the generator method periodically. The generator output will be '1' if there is a car or  '0' if there isn't.

\subsection{Random generator method}

For every events, the module has a 30{\%} chance of generating a car.

The toggle is used to invoke a change in the channel when there is a car. The change is used by the sensor to trigger its increment method.

\subsection{Generator method}

This module reads a dedicated text to show the different properties. 

All cases are presented below:
