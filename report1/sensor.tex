\section{Sensor module}

The sensor module allows to detect the passage of a car sent by the generator.

It also allows to count the number of cars waitting in the queue. This number will be update based on the generator module and the traffic light module.
To do this, we use a method, wich is sensitive to the generator, so increment the number of cars. To decrement this number, we use a thread. Both of those functions will be explained below.

\subsection{Sensor increment method}

Every cars sent by the generator will trigg the sensor method and the method will basically increment the number of cars in the concerned direction.   

\subsection{Sensor decrement thread}

At first, wich two seconds, we rewrite the output of the module with 'false' if there is no cars waitting in the queue or with 'true' if there are. 

And finally, we decrement the number of cars if the concerned traffic light is green.
